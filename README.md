because why not :)

i made this as harmless joke for school - you open a file with fake name and icon and it will take you... you know where

# How to use it? 

1. just download files and put it in folder somewhere
2. create a link of *main.py* on desktop
3. change it's name to whatever you want
4. for the ***icon***, you can use the one i created (i used icon of allplan, because we use it at school) or use your own. 
    - to change an icon, just right click a link on desktop you just created > properties > change icon and choose the icon
    - if you don't have an icon, you can use your own pretty simply...
        - 1st way is to select already existing icon, it can be .exe or .dll file of program that already exists for example
        - 2nd way is to choose your own image and convert it to icon. 
            - i used *[convertico.com](https://convertico.com/)*. upload your image and download your icon

***file.csv***  
this file will contain a date, when the file was openned  
to read this file, you can use excel or third-party software like [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)
> i use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), but that's not necessary
